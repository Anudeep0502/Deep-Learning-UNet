# UNet
The method I used to detect brain tumors is U-Net Network and referred to the paper named “U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation” by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox. I used a MR Image dataset that consists of 3929 brain images along with tumor masks. I performed various experiments by altering the UNet to find out the best model to predict a tumor in the brain.
